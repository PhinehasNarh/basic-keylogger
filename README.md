This project demonstrates a simple keylogger implemented in Python using the `pynput` library. Itâ€™s designed for **educational purposes only**, to help users understand how keyloggers work and learn defensive cybersecurity concepts.

## Features

- Captures keystrokes, including special keys (e.g., Enter, Shift).
- Logs keystrokes in a readable format.
- Stops logging when the **ESC** key is pressed.
- Educational tool for learning about keylogging, ethical hacking, and cybersecurity.

- Python 3.x
- **pynput** library (for handling keyboard inputs)

### Install `pynput`:
```bash
pip install pynput
```

## Usage

1. **Clone or download** this repository.
2. **Run the script** using the command:
